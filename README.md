# GitOps Pull Request Bot

A Git provider-agnostic bot (Bitbucket, GitHub, etc.) designed to manage the lifecycle of pull requests for GitOps-based Kubernetes workflows using tools like Flux or ArgoCD.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- PR event handling: open, update, merge, decline, and comment-based triggers.
- Dynamic environment deployments via GitOps.
- Preview environments before merging to `main`.
- Works with Flux and ArgoCD.
- Built in Go with vertical slicing architecture.

## üì¶ Use Case

When a pull request is opened on a GitOps repository, this bot listens for events but **does not automatically deploy changes**.

Instead, deployment actions are triggered explicitly by users through comments on the pull request.

### üîÅ Supported Commands

- `#gitbot deploy <environment>`
  Deploys the PR to the specified environment and locks all related apps to the PR branch.
  ‚ùó If the app is already locked by another PR, the deployment will be rejected.

- `#gitbot deploy <environment> <app-name>`
  Same as above, but limits the deployment to the specified application.

- `#gitbot deploy-force <environment>`
  Forces redeployment of all apps in the environment and **takes over any existing lock**, even if the app was previously deployed by another PR.

- `#gitbot deploy-force <environment> <app-name>`
  Same as above, but targets a specific app and **steals the lock** if necessary.

- `#gitbot rollback <environment>`
  Rolls back all apps in the specified environment to their previous state and removes any locks.

- `#gitbot rollback <environment> <app-name>`
  Rolls back a specific app in the given environment and removes its lock.

These commands enable precise and flexible GitOps workflows.
Locking ensures a single PR controls the lifecycle of each application in an environment.
The `deploy-force` command should be used with caution, as it can override active locks.

## üîß Supported Events

- `pull_request:open`
- `pull_request:update`
- `pull_request:merged`
- `pull_request:declined`
- `comment:deploy`
- `comment:rollback`
- `comment:deploy-force`
